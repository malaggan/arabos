mask irq 1 on irq 1 entry ?
check suprior irq 7 and check ISR and IRR values of PIC for that interrupt
use e9hack to print to bochsout.txt whenever a spurious irq occurs. checn check '1 now high'->'1 now low'->spurious irq%

sometimes the kb interrupt is masked. now, the kb handler will not know a button is pressed/released unless a secodn interrupt occurs and went unmasked. was the first interrupt acknowledged? does this has anything to do with bochs generating spurious interrupts?
